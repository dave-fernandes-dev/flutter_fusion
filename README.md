As name says it all that this starting project will let you build apps using `MVC` pattern.
This project uses `GetX` package for Routing and State management so we are following `Getx`'s MVC pattern.

We have a tweak in the MVC pattern we added a new layer of `Services` which makes it `MVCS` Pattern (as we call).
